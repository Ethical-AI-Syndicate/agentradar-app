# MCP Architecture - AgentRadar Custom Integrations

## Overview

This document defines the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration architecture for AgentRadar, enabling Claude to directly interact with internal services, deployment systems, monitoring platforms, and team workflows.

## MCP Chaining Workflows

### Example 1: Complete Feature Deployment
```yaml
chain: feature-deployment
steps:
  1. create-feature-branch:
      server: github-mcp
      action: create_branch
  2. implement-feature:
      server: agentradar-mcp
      action: generate_code
  3. run-tests:
      server: testing-mcp
      action: execute_test_suite
  4. deploy-staging:
      server: deployment-mcp
      action: deploy_to_staging
  5. run-integration-tests:
      server: testing-mcp
      action: integration_tests
  6. notify-team:
      server: slack-mcp
      action: send_message
  7. create-pr:
      server: github-mcp
      action: create_pull_request
```

### Example 2: Incident Response
```yaml
chain: incident-response
triggers:
  - error_rate > 5%
  - response_time > 3s
steps:
  1. capture-metrics:
      server: monitoring-mcp
      action: get_error_details
  2. create-incident:
      server: jira-mcp
      action: create_incident_ticket
  3. notify-oncall:
      server: slack-mcp
      action: page_oncall_engineer
  4. gather-logs:
      server: monitoring-mcp
      action: aggregate_logs
  5. suggest-fix:
      server: agentradar-mcp
      action: analyze_and_suggest
  6. deploy-hotfix:
      server: deployment-mcp
      action: emergency_deploy
```

## Security Model

### Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 for external services
- mTLS for internal communication
- API key rotation every 30 days
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Authorization Levels
1. **Read-Only**: Monitoring, log analysis
2. **Standard**: Feature development, testing
3. **Elevated**: Production deployments
4. **Emergency**: Hotfix deployments, rollbacks

### Audit Trail
- All MCP actions logged with timestamp
- User/session attribution
- Change tracking with diffs
- Compliance reporting

- Workflow automation

## Configuration Management

### MCP Server Registry
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "agentradar-core": {
      "url": "mcp://localhost:8080",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "capabilities": ["scrapers", "alerts", "whitelabel"]
    },
    "deployment": {
      "url": "mcp://localhost:8081",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "capabilities": ["docker", "kubernetes", "vercel"]
    },
    "monitoring": {
      "url": "mcp://localhost:8082",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "capabilities": ["metrics", "logs", "alerts"]
    },
    "team-tools": {
      "url": "mcp://localhost:8083",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "capabilities": ["jira", "slack", "github"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Specifications

### Latency Requirements
- Internal API calls: <100ms
- Deployment operations: <5 minutes
- Monitoring queries: <500ms
- Team tool updates: <2 seconds

### Throughput Targets
- 1000 requests/minute per server
- 100 concurrent operations
- 10GB/hour log processing
- 50 deployments/day capacity

## Error Handling

### Retry Strategy
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Max 3 retries for non-critical operations
- Circuit breaker at 50% error rate
- Fallback to manual intervention
